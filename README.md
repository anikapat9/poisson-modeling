Poisson Loan Default Modeling
Overview
This project simulates monthly loan defaults in a financial portfolio using the Poisson Distribution. It provides insights into modeling rare events, such as loan defaults, and calculates potential financial losses based on these simulations. The project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the practical application of probability in finance.

Features
Simulates loan defaults over a 12-month period using the Poisson Distribution.

Calculates potential losses based on default rates, loan amounts, and loss given default.

Visualizes monthly loan defaults with a bar chart for easy interpretation.

Motivation
Loan defaults are rare but impactful events in financial portfolios. Understanding and modeling these events is crucial for effective risk management. This project demonstrates how statistical techniques like the Poisson Distribution can be applied to simulate and analyze such scenarios.
