# Poisson Loan Default Modeling

## Overview
This project simulates monthly loan defaults in a financial portfolio using the **Poisson Distribution**. It provides insights into modeling rare events, such as loan defaults, and calculates potential financial losses based on these simulations.

## Features
- Simulates loan defaults over a 12-month period using the Poisson Distribution.
- Calculates potential losses based on default rates, loan amounts, and loss given default.
- Visualizes monthly loan defaults with a bar chart.

## Motivation
Loan defaults are rare but impactful events in financial portfolios. Understanding and modeling these events is crucial for effective risk management.
